AWS Infrastructure Automation with Terraform
Project Overview
This project demonstrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles by automating the deployment of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Key resources include:

S3 Bucket: Stores Terraform state files with versioning.
DynamoDB Table (Optional, for extra credit): Enables state locking to prevent concurrent updates.
VPC: Includes at least one public subnet.
EC2 Instance: Configured with a public IP, security groups, and SSH/HTTP access.
Prerequisites
To complete this project, ensure the following:

Terraform Installed: Use the latest version from the Terraform website.
AWS CLI Configured: Set up AWS CLI with access keys.
IAM Permissions: Your AWS credentials should allow S3, EC2, VPC, and DynamoDB operations.
Unique S3 Bucket Name: Bucket names must be globally unique.
Deployment Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Initialize Terraform: Initialize Terraform to download provider plugins and set up the backend:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Review the Plan: Review the resources that Terraform will create:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the Configuration: Deploy the resources to AWS:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Verify Resources:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Check the created S3 bucket, EC2 instance, VPC, and related configurations.
File Descriptions
backend.tf: Configures the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the Terraform backend.
main.tf: Defines AWS resources including the S3 bucket, EC2 instance, and VPC.
variables.tf: Contains variable definitions for resource configuration.
terraform.tfvars: Stores actual values for variables (excluded from version control for security).
provider.tf: Sets up the AWS provider.
README.md: Project documentation.
Best Practices
Modular Configuration: Variables are used for flexibility and to avoid hardcoding.
Backend Management: The S3 backend with versioning ensures reliable state tracking.
Security: Sensitive data is stored locally in terraform.tfvars and not committed to GitHub.
State Locking: DynamoDB table (if implemented) prevents concurrent state file updates.
Demonstration Guide
During your presentation/demo:

Run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply commands live.
Show the resources created in the AWS Management Console:
S3 bucket (with versioning enabled).
DynamoDB table for state locking (if applicable).
EC2 instance details (e.g., AMI, instance type, security group rules).
Explain the code structure, especially the use of variables.tf and terraform.tfvars.
Highlight challenges faced and solutions implemented.
Notes
Bucket Name: Ensure the S3 bucket name is unique to avoid deployment failures.
Terraform Backend: Update the backend.tf file or use a backend-config.hcl file for dynamic backend configuration.
Sensitive Data: Never push access keys or sensitive data to GitHub.
